:baphiewave:Why, hello there!
:baphie1:I wasn't expecting visitors today, what brings you two here?
:right1:Beep bop
:gf1:Ayo uhh you mind if we crash here today
:baphie1:Not at all! Feel free to stay for as long as you need to.
:gf1:Wow, really? Damn, that was easy.
:baphie1:Easy? What do you mean?
:gf1:Normally if we wanna do anything at all, we gotta battle some sore loser pissant just to do so.
:gf1:Which is, y'know, pretty much our LIVES at this point.
:gf1:But I guess the predicament's already been solved so-
:right1:Beep
:gf1:...what
:baphie1:Hm?
:right1:Bo bop skradoop
:gf1:Yo BF, you realize that he's letting us stay here for FREE, right?
:right1:beepa bop boop
:baphie1:...Huh..?
:gf1:Boyfriend, you do know that you don't have to sing against EVERYTHING in existence, right?
:gf1:For fuck sake, this goat guy is letting us stay the whole day here for free.
:baphie1:Ooh, singing? That actually doesn't sound too bad of an idea-
:gf1: Yo shut the fuck up real quick
:baphie1:
:right1:beppity boppa skedoop beep bap
:gf1:Boyfriend.
:gf1:...NO.
:right1:...

:baphie1:Of course, I'd love to!
:gf1:...
:gf1:Fucking kill me.
:baphie1:Oh don't worry! You two are more than free to stay here even if, ehm... "Boyfriend" doesn't win.
:baphie1:Although I can't quite seem to find myself a microphone anywhere-
:baphie1:
:right1:Bop
:baphie1:Oh... well, thank you!
:baphie1:...
:baphie1:Ow.
:gf1:Ok fine, since you're going to insist on a totally unnecessary rap battle...
:gf1:The rules are gonna stay in place, winner gets the girl!
:baphie1:Oh, uhm...
:baphie1:I uh... don't really wanna be responsible for breaking you two up...
:gf1:Oh, Baphie...
:gf1:Sweet, innocent, naive little fucking idiot Baphie...
:baphie1:How do you know my name I haven't even told you that yet-
:gf1:You're not quite familiar with how this whole shtick works, are you?
:baphie1:Well, I kind of just met the two of you, so ehm... not really...
:gf1:If you manage to best my Boyfriend in a rap battle, you get front row tickets to FUNKing me silly.
:gf1:Though Boyfriend manages to win every single battle he's ever fought in, so uh...
:gf1:Don't count on it.
:baphie1:Well you might not really have to worry about that because I'm sort of an...
:baphie1:Oh, How do I put this...
:baphie1:...Asexual..?
:gf1:...
:gf1:Fuck.
:baphie1:Though if you'd like, I have a few rented movies that we could watch together!
:baphie1:I've got some comedies as well as some dramas, and even a few horrors if you're into that.
:gf1:Nope, it doesn't work like that.
:baphie1:Ah, I see.
:baphie1:...Anyway, let's begin, shall we?
:baphie1:Would you like to start us off with some tunes?
:gf1:Can't, my speakers ran out of batteries getting over here.
:baphie1:Ahh, I see-
:baphie1:Wait a minute.
:baphie1:...
:baphie1:You mean you DROVE here on your speakers..?
:gf1:Well yeah..?
:gf1:How else do you expect me to get here, by walking on foot like a douchebag?
:baphie1:But... how do you even get speakers to do that..??
:gf1:Well, let's just say that being a demonspawn has it's perks.
:baphie1:
:baphie1:Ehhm...
:baphie1:Well anyway, luckily I bought some tunes to listen to yesterday while doing housework.
:baphie1:Maybe I could put them into the DVD slot and that could be just as good?
:gf1:I mean sure, I don't really see why not.
:baphie1:Goodie! Now let me just put it in...
:baphie1:...
:baphie1:Oh-
:baphie1:Ahh, crud... The TV's unplugged-
:gf1:Don't worry about it, the TV's already on.
:baphie1:What do you mean-
:baphie1:
:baphie1:what
:gf1:Again, being a demonspawn has-
:baphie1:Ahaha alright let's just start singing and not talk about that anymore..!
:gf1:Sounds like a plan.
